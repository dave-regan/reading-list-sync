# reading-list-sync
Fetches all the items I've saved to my Wikipedia reading list, and turns them into JSON that [familiar.energy](http://familiar.energy) can digest.

## to-do:
- Switch from the old Wiki API to `https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/`
- Fetch the description as well (this is useful when the extract isn't concise)
